If you've followed along from the [Beginning](00-overview.md) you would have seen this code:

```dart
_navigationService.replaceWith(Routes.homeView);
```

Navigation is part of Stacked Services, a group of services within Stacked that helps you perform certain tasks in your code. _To learn more about What a service is, [read this](/basics-in-depth/services.md)_.

The services currently included are:

1. [Navigation Service][#navigation]
2. Dialog Service
3. Bottom Sheet Service
4. Snackbar Service

...with more coming soon. In this doc we'll cover navigation.


# Navigation

The `NavigationService` is how you navigate within a Stacked app. It's accessible in all `ViewModels` through the locator where you can perform your navigational tasks.

Your Views will automatically be added to `app/app.dart` in the section below, when using the CLI to create a View. This will generate the navigation calls for you to use:

```dart lib/app/app.dart
@StackedApp(routes: [
  MaterialRoute(page: StartupView),
  MaterialRoute(page: HomeView),
  MaterialRoute(page: CounterView),
  // @stacked-route
])
class App {}
```


## Perform a Navigation

There are different navigation types. Lets go through all of them and see what they do.

### Navigate to a View

This is the most common navigation. This will add the `View` that you are navigating to onto the navigation stack. We do this by using the `navigateTo[ViewName]` function:

```dart
_navigationService.navigateToHomeView();
```

### Navigate to a View with Arguments

In your Stacked app generated at [the beginning](00-overview.md), open `home_view.dart` where we'll pass in a value to it through its constructor:

```dart
class HomeView extends StackedView<HomeViewModel> {
  final int startingIndex;
  const HomeView({Key? key, required this.startingIndex}) : super(key: key);
  ...
}
```

Now run `stacked generate`. You will notice that the `navigateToHomeView` call above will now have a compilation error. Since `startingIndex` is required, you will have to pass in the `startingIndex` value when navigating to the HomeView:

```dart
_navigationService.navigateToHomeView(startingIndex: 0);
```

### Replace with View

Another popular navigation method is to replace the current View on screen with the new one, instead of adding it to the top of the navigation stack. This is done by using the `replaceWith[ViewName]` function and works much the same as above:

```dart
_navigationService.replaceWithHomeView(startingIndex: 0);
```

### Back Navigation

When you want to go back one View to the previous View, you can use the `back` function:

```dart
_navigationService.back();
```

### Pass Data to the Previous View

The `back` function also takes a `result` parameter. This will pass the result back to the calling function. All navigation calls return a `Future` so that they can all be awaited:

```dart
final result = await _navigationService.replaceWithHomeView(startingIndex: 0);
print('Returned result: $result');
```

Given the code above, when you call:

```dart
_navigationService.back(result: 'From back call');
```

It will print `Returned result: From back call`. The result is `dynamic` so you can return any object, your own class, or built in types. In addition to the basics above, there are some additional functions that make some navigation tasks easier:

- **clearStackAndShow:** This will clear the entire navigation stack and then show the `HomeView`:

```dart
_navigationService.clearStackAndShow(Routes.homeView);
```

More advanced docs and tutorials for navigation are coming soon.

### Custom Transitions

In Flutter the `MaterialRoute` and `CupertinoRoute` has pre-defined transitions. To supply your own transition you have to use a `CustomRoute`. Stacked allows you to do that. The transition can be supplied to the `StackedApp` to ensure any navigation to this view uses the supplied transition, or it can be supplied when navigating to the view. 

**Supplied at App Level**

In your `app.dart` file when you define the route use a `CustomRoute` over a `Material` or `CupertinoRoute`.

```dart
@StackedApp(routes: [
  MaterialRoute(page: StartupView),
  MaterialRoute(page: HomeView),
  CustomRoute(page: CounterView), // <== Custom Route
  // @stacked-route
])
class App {}
```

The custom route allows you to supply a transition property as well. This HAS to be a static builder function. Stacked comes with pre-defined transitions which you can use. We cover the basic transitions like `fadeIn`, `zoomIn`, `slideLeft`, `slideRight` and many more under the `TransitionsBuilders` class. Lets use the fade for our example.

```dart
@StackedApp(routes: [
  ...
  CustomRoute(
    page: CounterView, 
    transitionsBuilder: TransitionsBuilders.fadeIn,
  ),
  // @stacked-route
])
class App {}
```

Now run `stacked generate` and when you navigate to this view you'll see it fade in. If you want no transition (this is usually preferred on web) then remove the transition builder and only keep the `CustomRoute`.

**Set Transition When Navigating**

In addition to supplying the transition at an app level you can also supply the transition when you perform the navigation. To achieve this your route still has to be a `CustomRoute` to ensure that Flutter allows Stacked to build the transition you want. This does not require a regenerate of the code to get it working, only that the code has been regenerated as a `CustomRoute`.

```dart
  await _navigationService.navigateTo(
    Routes.secondView,
    transition: TransitionsBuilders.fadeIn,
  );
```

**Build Your Own Transition**

The way to build the transition is quite simple. You create a class with your `Transitions` and inside you create a static function with the following signature. `Widget Function(BuildContext context, Animation<double> animation, Animation<double> secondaryAnimation, Widget child)` . This function will be called as the transition happens. Here's an example a transition using the `Animations` package.

```dart
import 'package:animations/animations.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class CustomRouteTransition {
  static Widget sharedAxis(BuildContext context, Animation<double> animation,
      Animation<double> secondaryAnimation, Widget child) {

    // Here you can use any Existing Transition class in Flutter
    return SharedAxisTransition(
      animation: animation,
      secondaryAnimation: secondaryAnimation,
      transitionType: SharedAxisTransitionType.scaled,
      child: child,
    );
  }
}
```

This can be used as the same as the Transitions that ship with Stacked in the `TransitionBuilders` class. 

```dart
// In app.dart
CustomRoute(
  page: CounterView, 
  transitionsBuilder: CustomRouteTransition.sharedAxis,
),

// When navigating
await _navigationService.navigateTo(
  Routes.secondView,
  transition: transitionsBuilder: CustomRouteTransition.sharedAxis,
);
```
